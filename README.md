# Amazon Sentiment Analysis 

## Project Overview

In this project, we use Sentimental Analysis to predict whether a review is 'Positive,' 'Neutral,' or 'Negative' based on reviews on a million goods from Amazon's Toys and Amazon Electronics datasets.

## Problem Statement

Amazon Reviews will be misleading as the content may be subjective(positive or negative) and sometimes may lack the information.
