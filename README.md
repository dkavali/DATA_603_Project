## *Project Overview*

In this project, we use Sentimental Analysis to predict whether a review is 'Positive,' 'Neutral,' or 'Negative' based on reviews on a million goods from Amazon's Toys and Amazon Electronics datasets. 

## *Source of Dataset*

## *Problem Statement*

Amazon Reviews will be misleading as the content may be subjective(positive or negative) and sometimes may lack the information. Finding out whether the review is positive, negative or neutral is a critical task. 

## *Bigdata Tools*

We have used the following bigdata tools:
1. MongoDB
2. Apache Spark
3. QlikSense
4. Tableau

## Steps to run the file

We have 2 files to run - 
1. With a senntiment dataset and word cloud visualizations - This can be executed as normal .ipynb file
2. Second file is required to have MongoDb connection as the data is retrieved from MongoDb in the notebook. This notebook will also need Apache Spark as it is coded in Apache Spark.
