## *Project Overview*

In this project, we use Sentimental Analysis to predict whether a review is 'Positive,' 'Neutral,' or 'Negative' based on reviews on a million goods from Amazon's Toys and Amazon Electronics datasets.

## *Problem Statement*

Amazon Reviews will be misleading as the content may be subjective(positive or negative) and sometimes may lack the information. Finding out whether the review is positive, negative or neutral is a critical task. 

## *Bigdata Tools*

We have used the following bigdata tools:
1. MongoDB
2. Apache Spark
3. QlikSense
4. Tableau
